## Exploring Bikeshare Data For Chicago, NYC, and Washington D.C.

### Python Code created on 5/23/23. README.md created on 6/27/23.

## Description: 
* Python code used to analyze data provided by [Motivate](https://motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States. 
* Interactive code allows the user to look into bikeshare data from these large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. 
* The user can enter in the city, month, and day to find out the following information: 
    - popular times of travel 
    - the most frequent combination of start station and end station 
    - trip durations (total travel time and average travel times) 
    - user info: for ex. counts of each user type, and for NYC and Chicago only: the count of gender and age information (oldest, youngest and most common year of birth)
* The user also gets an opportunity to see five rows of formatted data at a time.

## Files used
